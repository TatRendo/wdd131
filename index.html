                <div class="content"></div>
                    <p>I am a BYU student andI am excited to be able to learn to program in different programming languages. <br>
                        I am someone who values responsibility in all areas of my life. In the workplace, I dedicate myself to fulfilling 
                        tasks with diligence and efficiency, always seeking ways to positively contribute to the team. My family holds a 
                        special place in my heart, and I am always ready to offer support and dedication to maintain strong family ties.<br>
                        Concerning my studies, I view education as an invaluable tool, constantly seeking ways to apply what I've learned 
                        in practical situations. I am passionate about the idea of continual intellectual growth and contributing to the world 
                        around me with my knowledge. <br>
                        In my home, I share my life with an adorable gray cat who brightens my days with their company. Their presence adds 
                        warmth and joy to my space, turning it into a cozy haven after each day.</p>
